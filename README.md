# kryptoJobs2Go

The task was to open a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called KryptoJobs2Go. KryptoJobs2Go is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. The platform will be integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

The Challenge was to develop the code that enables customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, we assumed the perspective of a KryptoJobs2Go customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

Once it's all been put together, and launched the Streamlit web interface, it's time to test the KryptoJobs2Go application with newly integrated Ethereum wallet. We sent a test transaction by using the applicationâ€™s web interface, and then looked up the resulting transaction in Ganache. The transaction was successfully went through and recorded.
